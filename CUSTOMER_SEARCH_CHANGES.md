# Customer Search Page - Dynamic Implementation

## Summary
The Customer Search page has been updated to dynamically fetch and display vehicles from the database that were added by providers.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Added Dynamic Data Fetching**
   - Replaced static vehicle data with API calls to the backend
   - Integrated with existing `/api/vehicles/search` endpoint
   - Vehicles are fetched from MongoDB database

### 2. **State Management**
   - Added `vehicles` state to store fetched vehicles
   - Added `loading` state to show loading indicator
   - Added `error` state to handle and display errors

### 3. **useEffect Hook**
   - Automatically fetches all available vehicles when component loads
   - Ensures data is fresh on every page visit

### 4. **Updated Search Filters**
   - **Location**: Changed from dropdown to text input (matches database schema)
   - **Vehicle Type**: Updated options to match database schema (car, bike, scooter)
   - **Price Range**: Updated to Indian Rupees (₹) with appropriate ranges
   - **Company**: Added text input to search by vehicle company/manufacturer
   - **Removed**: Availability filter (using status from database instead)

### 5. **Enhanced Search Functionality**
   - `handleSearch()` - Triggers filtered search with query parameters
   - `handleClearFilters()` - Resets all filters and fetches all vehicles
   - Builds proper query string for backend API

### 6. **Dynamic Vehicle Display**
   - Shows all vehicle information from database:
     - Company, Model, Year
     - Daily Rate (in ₹)
     - Location
     - Vehicle Type
     - License Plate
     - Features (if available)
     - Description (if available)
     - Provider information
     - Status (available/rented/maintenance)
   - Displays vehicle images if uploaded, placeholder if not
   - "Book Now" button disabled for non-available vehicles

### 7. **User Feedback**
   - Loading spinner while fetching data
   - Error messages if fetch fails
   - "No vehicles found" message when no results
   - Vehicle count display
   - Clear visual indicators for vehicle status

## Backend Integration

The page uses the existing backend API:
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/vehicles/search`
- **Base URL**: `http://localhost:5000`
- **Query Parameters**:
  - `location` - Search by location (partial match)
  - `type` - Filter by vehicle type (car/bike/scooter)
  - `company` - Search by company name (partial match)
  - `minRate` - Minimum daily rate
  - `maxRate` - Maximum daily rate

## Database Schema Used

The page displays vehicles based on the `Vehicle` model:
```javascript
{
  company: String,
  model: String,
  year: Number,
  licensePlate: String,
  dailyRate: Number,
  location: String,
  features: [String],
  description: String,
  images: [String],
  provider: ObjectId (populated with name/businessName),
  type: String (car/bike/scooter),
  status: String (available/rented/maintenance)
}
```

## Testing Checklist
