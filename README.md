# Zuper
Zuper is a full-stack web application being built to simplify vehicle rentals and subscriptions. It enables customers to lease cars, bikes, or scooters through flexible plans, while providers can list and manage their vehicles. Using React, Node.js, and MongoDB, Zuper integrates Razorpay (test mode) for payments and offers role-based dashboards for customers, providers, and admins. Features will include contract management, mileage caps, renewals, and upgrade options, making it a scalable and extensible platform for the modern subscription economy.
