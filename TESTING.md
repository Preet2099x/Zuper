## Setup Instructions

### Backend Testing

1. **Install dependencies**:
```bash
cd backend
npm install --save-dev jest supertest

"scripts": {
  "test": "jest --detectOpenHandles",
  "test:watch": "jest --watch"
}
```

### Frontend Testing

1. **Install testing libraries**:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install --save-dev @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom jest @babel/preset-react
```

```json
"scripts": {
  "test": "jest",
  "test:watch": "jest --watch"
}
```

## Running Tests

### Run all tests
```bash
npm test
```

### Run tests in watch mode (auto-rerun on file changes)
```bash
npm run test:watch
```

### Run specific test file
```bash
npm test -- bookingController.test.js
```

### Run tests with coverage
```bash
npm test -- --coverage
```

### Run tests matching a pattern
```bash
npm test -- --testNamePattern="should calculate"
```

## Important Test Scenarios

### Critical Booking Workflow
```javascript
// Test: Complete booking lifecycle
1. Customer creates booking request (status: pending)
2. Provider receives in inbox
3. Provider approves booking (status: approved, contract created)
4. Vehicle status changes to 'rented'
5. Booking appears in customer's "My Bookings"
6. Customer can view details

// Test: Cancellation Flow
1. Customer views pending booking
2. Clicks "Cancel Request" button
3. Confirmation dialog appears
4. After confirmation, booking removed from list
5. Success message displayed
```

### Validation Tests
```javascript
// Test: Date validation
✓ Past start date → Rejected
✓ End date before start date → Rejected
✓ Valid future dates → Accepted
✓ Same day booking → Accepted

// Test: Cost calculation
✓ 1 day × ₹1500 = ₹1500
✓ 5 days × ₹1500 = ₹7500
✓ 30 days × ₹1500 = ₹45000

// Test: Status transitions
✓ pending → approved ✓
✓ pending → rejected ✓
✓ pending → cancelled ✓
✓ approved → cancelled ✗ (Invalid)
```

## Common Test Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "Cannot find module" errors
**Solution**: Ensure all imports use correct relative paths with `.js` extension for ES modules
```javascript
import BookingRequest from '../models/BookingRequest.js';
```

### Issue: Tests timeout
**Solution**: Add timeout configuration in jest.config.js
```javascript
testTimeout: 10000
```

### Issue: Async test failures
**Solution**: Properly handle promises and async/await
```javascript
test('async test', async () => {
  const result = await fetchData();
  expect(result).toBeDefined();
});
```

### Issue: State not updating in tests
**Solution**: Mock state setters and verify they're called correctly
```javascript
const setState = jest.fn();
setState(newValue);
expect(setState).toHaveBeenCalledWith(newValue);
```

## Next Steps

1. **Run all tests** to verify setup:
```bash
npm test
```

2. **View coverage report**:
```bash
npm test -- --coverage
```

3. **Set up continuous integration** (GitHub Actions):
```yaml
name: Tests
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm test
```

## Test Best Practices

✅ **DO**:
- Test business logic, not implementation details
- Use descriptive test names
- Keep tests focused on one behavior
- Mock external dependencies
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Keep tests independent

❌ **DON'T**:
- Test implementation details
- Make tests dependent on each other
- Skip error cases
- Write overly complex tests
- Test third-party libraries
- Ignore test failures
