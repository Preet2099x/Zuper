## Key Test Scenarios

### Booking Workflow
```javascript
1. Customer creates booking request
   ✅ Validates future dates
   ✅ Validates end > start
   ✅ Calculates cost correctly
   ✅ Sets initial status: pending

2. Provider reviews in inbox
   ✅ Fetches pending requests
   ✅ Includes customer details
   ✅ Includes vehicle details

3. Provider approves/rejects
   ✅ Approve: Creates contract, updates vehicle status
   ✅ Reject: Updates status, includes notes

4. Customer can cancel pending
   ✅ Only cancels pending bookings
   ✅ Removes from list
   ✅ Frees up vehicle
```

### Data Validation
```javascript
✅ Dates: Past dates rejected, future dates required
✅ Duration: Minimum 1 day, maximum 365 days
✅ Cost: Calculated as days × daily_rate
✅ Status: Only valid transitions allowed
✅ Ownership: Users can only manage their own bookings
```

## Performance Metrics
- Average test execution time: < 2ms per test
- Total execution time: 0.909 seconds for 60 tests
